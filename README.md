# AI Voice Command Chatbot

## Overview
This project involves the creation of an AI voice command chatbot using the OpenAI library. The chatbot is designed to respond to voice commands and carry out various tasks or provide information based on predefined commands.

## Project Goals
- Develop a voice-activated chatbot using the OpenAI library.
- Implement voice recognition and predefined command execution.
- Enable the chatbot to execute commands or provide relevant responses in real-time.

## Key Features
- Voice Recognition: The chatbot utilizes speech-to-text technology to recognize voice commands.
- Predefined Commands: Responds to a set of predefined commands without natural language processing.
- OpenAI Integration: Utilizes OpenAI library for generating responses based on predefined commands.
- Voice Output: Capable of providing responses in natural language through voice synthesis.

## Technologies Used
- OpenAI Library
- Speech-to-Text API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text)
- Text-to-Speech API (e.g., Google Cloud Text-to-Speech)
- [Any additional technologies or libraries used]

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. [Insert any additional setup instructions if necessary]
3. Run the main script to start the chatbot.

## Usage
1. Activate the chatbot by triggering the voice recognition system.
2. Speak clearly and provide predefined voice commands or questions.
3. The chatbot will process the input and execute the corresponding predefined command or provide the appropriate response.
